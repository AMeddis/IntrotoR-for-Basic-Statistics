# We want to plot the diameter growth over time by treatment group
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Make a boxplot of the diameter change by Day 



# 2. Calculate the median change by treatment and Day ( you can use the aggregate)
#     ( store the results in the environment, you would need it for the plot)


# 2a. Rename the column "diam.change"  with "median.change" of the data.frame obtained by the aggregate 



# 2b. Create a plot with the points at the median change from time 0 at varying
#    of days where the color is defined by the treatment group. Add a legend.
